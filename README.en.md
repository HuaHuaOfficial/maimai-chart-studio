# maimai Chart Studio 1.2.0

[简体中文](README.md) | English

maimai Chart Studio is a local Windows chart generator. Version 1.2.0 adds causal, structure-preserving WHERE reranking after high-difficulty generation. Any changed full chart must receive a new CUDA Harness acceptance and publish permit.

## Supported generation

- BASIC and ADVANCED use lightweight V4 combined sampling and remain oriented toward simple configurations; EXPERT, MASTER, and Re:MASTER use joint WHAT followed by relational WHERE. The old factorized WHAT fallback is not used.
- All five difficulties share the contextual V4 renderer and CUDA Harness, but production intentionally uses a lightweight lower-difficulty path and a heavier higher-difficulty path.
- Star, double-note, Hold, Touch, and Touch Hold controls operate in one normalized configuration distribution.
- `stable` is the default search. `causal-v1` is an optional bounded recovery mode for EXPERT and above; both modes use the same planner, renderer, and Harness.
- A chart is written only after full-chart CUDA evaluation returns ACCEPT and a permit is bound to the exact content digest.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- NVIDIA CUDA GPU
- A CUDA-enabled PyTorch build compatible with the installed driver
- Python 3.11 or newer
- FFmpeg is bundled in both the formal Git repository (via Git LFS) and the release; no separate installation or `PATH` setup is required

Install the Python dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Double-click `启动生成器.pyw` to open the local Studio. Audio and media assets remain on the computer.

The form requires audio, title, BPM, chart version, difficulty, and exact internal level. Song ID is optional: automatic IDs start at 3000 before DX and 13000 from DX onward, and are persisted without reuse. Cover and BGA MP4 are optional.
- Choosing or uploading a new audio clears the previous cover and BGA selections; the title still defaults to the audio filename.
- Automatic song-ID allocation uses a cross-process lock, so simultaneous Studio instances do not receive the same ID.

## Bundled FFmpeg and optional preview tools

Both the formal Git repository (via Git LFS) and the release ZIP bundle the Windows x64 FFmpeg runtime. A normal LFS-enabled clone materializes `tools/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe`; if LFS was skipped during clone, run `git lfs pull`. MiaCode and MajdataViewX remain optional external tools; extract them into the application's `tools` directory if desired. The runtime recognizes:

```text
maimai Chart Studio 1.2.0/
└─ tools/
   ├─ ffmpeg/
   │  ├─ ffmpeg.exe
   │  ├─ BUILD_INFO.txt
   │  └─ LICENSE-GPL-3.0.txt
   ├─ MiaCode-v1.0.0-win64/
   │  └─ MiaCode.exe
   └─ MajdataViewX-v6.2.0/
      └─ MajdataEdit-Neo.exe
```

- FFmpeg is tracked in the formal Git repository via LFS and bundled in releases at `tools/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe`. The runtime prefers this bundled binary and accepts a system `PATH` installation only as a compatibility fallback.
- MiaCode requires `tools/MiaCode-v1.0.0-win64/MiaCode.exe`.
- MajdataViewX requires `tools/MajdataViewX-v6.2.0/MajdataEdit-Neo.exe`.

The Studio checks each editor/viewer executable before asking for a `maidata.txt` file.

## Output layout

```text
output/
└─ Song title-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
   ├─ 元数据.json
   └─ SongId/
      ├─ maidata.txt
      ├─ track.mp3
      ├─ bg.png (optional)
      └─ pv.mp4 (optional)
```



## Preview

- A video with an audio track can be selected once as both music and BGA. Publication splits it into a normalized 320 kbps `track.mp3` and a video-only `pv.mp4`; the video stream is copied without re-encoding.
MiaCode and MajdataViewX are optional external tools exposed as two separate actions in the Studio. If MajdataViewX is unavailable, the action reports the installation locations instead of opening a built-in preview. Install it at `tools/MajdataViewX-v6.2.0` or `.tools/MajdataViewX-v6.2.0`, or set `MAJDATA_EXE` to the `MajdataEdit-Neo.exe` path.
- Cover and BGA controls use fixed-size drop zones. BGA preview is a static thumbnail extracted by the bundled FFmpeg, so the browser never needs to decode the original MP4; source media is never modified, and the final video-only `pv.mp4` remuxes the original video stream without transcoding. Clear buttons remove only the current selection and never delete the source file.
